Abstract

Precise prediction of crop prices is very essential for agriculture as it would help farmers, policymakers, and stakeholders in the supply chain make informed decisions to support food security and economic stability, plus resource planning. This project involves the development of a machine learning model to predict crop prices from multi-input perspectives such as environmental conditions, soil types, crop yields, and irrigation methods. We make use of a historical dataset containing crop prices and related features such as rainfall, temperature, and humidity. We preprocess data through encoding categorical variables along with detection and removal of outliers and standardization of numerical features. Feature ranking was applied to understand the influence of the variables on crop prices and select the high-impact predictors. Along with more classic techniques - Multiple Linear Regression and Decision Trees the paper also covered Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost and more. All models underwent hyperparameter optimization; MSE and R² were used as measures for assessing the results of fitted models. At the stages of the research, it was determined that tree-based models deliver the best accuracy in terms of prediction, especially the ones based on XGBoost. The final model is coupled with an interactive prediction function that lets the user input key agricultural factors to obtain a crop price prediction using the trained model. This instrument can be of great importance when predicting price trends and planning agricultural operations. Further improvements can involve increasing the dataset and fine-tuning model parameters for more accurate robustness.

INTRODUCTION
The major problem facing the agricultural industry is crop price instability. Such crops as Paddy, wheat, and coffee all face unpredictable variability in their prices. Such price instability is spurred by weather conditions, soil type, market demand, and supply chain dynamics. Unstable crop prices create uncertainty and make it relatively difficult for producers to plan their operations and efficiently allocate resources towards ensuring a stable income. Such volatility affects not only the fate of an individual farmer but spills over to affect the larger agricultural economy and food security at large.
 
An ideal solution to this problem would be a reliable, data-driven tool that supplies farmers with accurate crop price forecasts. Such a tool would empower farmers by letting them be able to forecast price trends, make well-informed decisions as to what crops to plant, when to harvest, and when to sell. Predictable prices would allow farmers to better manage risks related to finance, manage investments, and increase the potential profitability in their output through optimal production strategies.
1.1 Motivation
The primary motivation for this project is to address the financial instability and uncertainty faced by farmers due to unpredictable crop prices. Farmers invest considerable time, labour, and resources into growing crops, yet fluctuating market prices can make it difficult to cover costs or earn a sustainable income. This unpredictability, driven by factors like weather conditions, soil quality, crop yields, and shifting demand, leaves farmers vulnerable to financial losses and limits their ability to plan effectively.
By developing a machine learning model that can accurately predict crop prices based on a comprehensive set of environmental, economic, and historical factors, this project aims to empower farmers with actionable insights. The tool will enable them to make informed decisions regarding crop selection, harvesting schedules, and market timing, ultimately reducing financial risk and promoting greater income stability. Additionally, this project holds potential benefits for policymakers and agricultural organizations, offering them data-driven insights to better support farmers, stabilize markets, and enhance food security.
1.2 Problem Definition
The primary challenge for farmers is the unpredictability of crop prices. Current crop pricing models lack precision in capturing the diverse, complex factors that influence price, such as rainfall, soil type, crop yield, and regional conditions. Existing systems often provide broad or generic pricing trends, failing to account for the specific environmental and economic conditions faced by farmers in different areas. Furthermore, many of the tools available today are not accessible to smaller farmers who lack advanced resources or technical expertise. This project seeks to address these gaps by developing a machine learning-based model capable of predicting crop prices with a high degree of accuracy using a comprehensive dataset of environmental, agricultural, and economic factors.
1.3 Objectives of the Project
Develop a system that accurately forecasts the value of crops by analysing historical agricultural data, helping farmers make informed decisions.
To optimize agricultural output and profitability by leveraging data-driven insights.



PROPOSED SYSTEM
3.1 Methodology
The methodology follows a structured approach that includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and user interaction for real-time predictions. Each phase is detailed below.

3.1.1 Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in ensuring the dataset is clean, consistent, 	and ready for modelling. In this project, the preprocessing involved the 		following steps:
Loading the Dataset:
The dataset is loaded from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.
Categorical Encoding:
Categorical variables such as Location, Soil, Irrigation, and Crop are encoded into numerical representations using .astype('category').cat.codes.
Mappings of these categories are created to retain consistency between the categorical variables and their numerical codes. Reverse mappings are also stored for decoding purposes during user predictions.
Outlier Detection and Removal:
Outliers are identified and removed using the Z-score method to improve model accuracy. Any data point with a Z-score greater than 3 or less than -3 is considered an outlier and is excluded from the dataset.
Train-Test Split:
The dataset is split into training (80%) and test (20%) sets to evaluate model performance on unseen data.
Feature Scaling:
Feature scaling is performed using StandardScaler to ensure all features are on a comparable scale, with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. This scaling is essential for models sensitive to feature magnitude, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

3.1.2 Feature Selection
Feature selection helps in identifying the most influential features that impact 	crop prices. This phase includes:
Ranking Features with SelectKBest:
SelectKBest with f_regression is used to evaluate the importance of each feature based on its correlation with the target variable, Price.
The top features are selected based on their scores, providing insights into which variables have the most significant impact on crop prices.
Interpretation of Feature Importance:
The feature scores allow prioritization of features that most strongly influence crop prices, which helps improve model accuracy and interpretability.

3.1.3 	Model Selection and Training
A diverse set of machine learning models was selected and trained to identify 	the best-performing model for crop price prediction. This phase includes:
Model Selection:
The following models were selected for their varying abilities to capture linear and non-linear relationships:
Tree-Based Models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and CatBoost.
Linear Models: Linear Regression, Ridge, and Lasso.
Other Models: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV:
Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to optimize model parameters. A custom grid of hyperparameters is defined for each model, and the optimal configuration is selected based on the R² score.
Model Training:
Each model is trained with its optimal hyperparameters on the training dataset. The final, tuned models are then evaluated on the test data for performance comparison.

3.1.4 Model Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of each trained model, standard metrics are used 	to assess prediction accuracy.
Performance Metrics:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values. Lower MSE values indicate better model performance.
R² Score: Indicates the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model. A higher R² score (closer to 1) denotes a more accurate model.
Model Selection:
Based on the MSE and R² scores, the best model (Random Forest) is selected for crop price prediction. This model provides a good balance of accuracy and interpretability.
Feature Importance Analysis for Tree-Based Models:
Feature importance is visualized for the Random Forest model to highlight which features have the highest impact on predictions. This helps in interpreting the factors that influence crop prices most significantly.

3.1.5 User Input and Real-Time Prediction
A user-friendly interface allows real-time prediction of crop prices based on 	custom inputs.
Input Gathering:
The predict_crop_price function prompts users for inputs on factors such as Location, Soil, Irrigation, Crop, Year, Area, Rainfall, Temperature, Yields, Humidity, and Demand.
Input Encoding:
Categorical inputs (e.g., Location, Soil, Irrigation) are mapped to numerical codes using stored mappings from the preprocessing phase. This ensures consistency between the input data format and the model's requirements.
Scaling User Input:
The user's input data is scaled using the StandardScaler object used during preprocessing. This ensures that the new inputs match the scaled features used in model training.
Prediction:
The scaled input data is fed into the selected model (Random Forest) to predict the crop price. The predicted price is then displayed to the user.
Interpretation:
The predicted crop price helps users understand how different factors affect pricing, allowing them to make informed agricultural and market-related decisions.
